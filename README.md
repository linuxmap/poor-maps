Poor Maps is an application for Sailfish OS to display tiled maps (e.g.
OpenStreetMap), places and routes with a flexible selection of data and
service providers.

For testing purposes you can just run `qmlscene qml/poor-maps.qml`. For
installation, you can build the RPM package with command `make rpm`. You
don't need an SDK to build the RPM, only basic tools: `make`,
`rpmbuild`, `gettext` and `linguist` from `qttools`
